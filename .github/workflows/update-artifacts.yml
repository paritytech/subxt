      # This starts a substrate node and runs a few subxt cli child processes to fetch metadata from it and generate code.
      # In particular it generates:
      # - 4 metadata (*.scale) files in the `artifacts` directory
      # - a polkadot.rs file from the full metadata that is checked in integration tests
      # - a polkadot.json in the `artifacts/demo_chain_specs` directory

          body: |
            This PR updates the artifacts by fetching fresh metadata from a substrate node.
            It also recreates the polkadot.rs file used in the integration tests.
            It was created automatically by a Weekly GitHub Action Cronjob.
