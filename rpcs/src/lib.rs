//! This crate provides a low level RPC interface to Substrate based nodes.
//!
//! See the [`client`] module for a [`client::RpcClient`] which is driven by implementations
//! of [`client::RpcClientT`] (several of which are provided behind feature flags).
//!
//! See the [`methods`] module for structs which implement sets of concrete RPC calls for
//! communicating with Substrate based nodes. These structs are all driven by a [`client::RpcClient`].
//!
//! The RPC clients/methods here are made use of in `subxt`. Enabling the `subxt` feature flag ensures
//! that all Subxt configurations are also valid RPC configurations.
//!
//! The provided RPC client implementations can be used natively (with the default `native` feature
//! flag) or in WASM based web apps (with the `web` feature flag).
