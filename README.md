# subxt &middot; ![build](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/workflows/Rust/badge.svg) [![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/subxt.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/subxt) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/subxt/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/subxt)

Subxt is a library for interacting with [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) based nodes in Rust and WebAssembly. It can:

- Submit Extrinsics (this is where the name comes from).
- Subscribe to blocks, reading the extrinsics and associated events from them.
- Read and iterate over storage values.
- Read constants and custom values from the metadata.
- Call runtime APIs, returning the results.
- Do all of the above via a safe, statically types interface or via a dynamic one when you need the flexibility.
- Compile to WASM and run entirely in the browser.
- Do a bunch of things in a `#[no_std]` environment via the `subxt-core` crate.
- Use a built-in light client (`smoldot`) to interact with chains.

## Usage

Take a look in the [examples](./subxt/examples) folder or the [examples](./examples) folder for various smaller or
larger `subxt` usage examples, or [read the guide](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/book/index.html) to learn more.

### Downloading metadata from a Substrate node

Use the [`subxt-cli`](./cli) tool to download the metadata for your target runtime from a node.

1. Install:

```bash
cargo install subxt-cli
```

2. Save the encoded metadata to a file:

```bash
subxt metadata -f bytes > metadata.scale
```

This defaults to querying the metadata of a locally running node on the default `http://localhost:9933/`. If querying
a different node then the `metadata` command accepts a `--url` argument.

## Subxt Documentation

For more details regarding utilizing subxt, please visit the [documentation](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/).

## Integration Testing

Most tests require a running substrate node to communicate with. This is done by spawning an instance of the
substrate node per test. It requires an up-to-date `substrate` executable on your path.

This can be installed from source via cargo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk staging-node-cli --force
```
